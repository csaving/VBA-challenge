## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze generated stock market data using VBA scripting. The results will show for each stock the yearly change in stock price, percent change and total stock volume. It will also show which stock had greatest percent increase, which had greatest decrease and which had greatest total stock volume. 

The VBA file stock_analysis.bas can be imported to an Excel spreadsheet and run as a macro. The Excel file should contain raw stock data with one year per worksheet. The data should be sorted by ticker, then by date.
